# Known issues and gaps

Problems known in ERPNext for our use, and features ERPNext does not have that we must build.
Each item should have a GitHub issue; put its number in the last column once created.

## Known problems

| Problem | Details | Planned | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arabic text breaks in charts | Reported in the owner demo: Arabic labels in dashboard charts do not display correctly. Charts use frappe-charts (SVG). Needs a screenshot and exact steps. | Decision and fix in week 10 | — |
| Missing / wrong Arabic translations | Parts of the interface stay in English or are mistranslated (e.g. "Amount", "Nos" on the invoice). The invoice is already fixed by the MMG Sales Invoice print format. | Full translation in week 11 | — |
| Print formats | Only the sales invoice has an Arabic format so far. | Week 11 | — |

### Issue text: Arabic text breaking in charts

> **Title:** Arabic text breaks in dashboard charts
>
> **Steps:** log in as a user with the Arabic interface, open the Owner Dashboard, look at "Revenue by
> Business" and "Stock Value by Warehouse".
>
> **Expected:** Arabic labels read correctly, right to left.
>
> **Actual:** Arabic text in the charts breaks (as seen in the owner demo). _Attach a screenshot and say
> exactly where: axis labels, legend or tooltip._
>
> **Scope:** frappe-charts SVG rendering; affects every Dashboard Chart with Arabic labels.
>
> **Plan:** decide in week 10 between (a) English labels on charts, (b) patching the chart labels with
> RTL shaping, (c) another chart library for the owner dashboard.
>
> Labels: `bug`, `CORE`, `Configuration`
